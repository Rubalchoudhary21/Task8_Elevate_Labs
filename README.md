## ✍️ Summary
VPNs encrypt internet traffic and mask your IP address, improving privacy and protecting data from eavesdropping—especially on public Wi-Fi networks.

**Limitations:**
- Free VPNs often have limited speeds and fewer server options.
- VPNs **do not** prevent all tracking methods, such as cookies and browser fingerprinting.
- For maximum privacy, VPNs should be used in combination with other security tools (e.g., private browsers, anti-tracking extensions).

## 🎯 Outcome
Gained practical experience setting up and using a VPN and developed an understanding of how VPNs enhance online privacy and security.
